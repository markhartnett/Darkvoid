To initialise the server, run \src\main\java\com\hackstreetboys\darkvoid\repository\DarkvoidApplication

The home page for the client can be found at \frontend\home.html
The client should be run at http://localhost:63342/ to be allowed to interact with the server. This is the default port where IntelliJ runs HTML files.

Cookies need to be enabled to use this app, and cookies may need to be cleared for localhost for expected performance.

In order to allow this app to run without it's self signed certificate, on Google Chrome you can go to chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost, change the setting to allow self-signed certificates on localhost and restart Chrome.

The app provides 2 pre-made accounts with constant username and passwords for testing. A student account can be found with username TheFlyingPolak, and a staff accound with the username joeb123.
Both accounts have the same password: "pASSw0rd!" without quoted.
